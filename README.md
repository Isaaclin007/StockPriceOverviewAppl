possible that external dependencies, that this 
code is built to rely on, have changed or become defunct.

*Note #3*. There is some awkward possibility that program might 
not work in certain circumstances at all (or 
some unknown adjustment is needed), and some more 
adjustments/installations are needed.<br>
