#### In case program does not start/run

*Note #1*. Haven't tested with other than mentioned specifics (see below) - it might and then again it might not work with different setup.<br> 
*Note #2*. There is always possiblity that when running some Python program written by others, that some packages are not available/not in computer/environment where it is being run (then have to try to install them manually - but this is already, out of scope of this document, and specific to every python setup/environment).<br>
*Note #3*. And there is some awkward possibility that program might not work in certain circumstances at all, or some other adjustments are needed.<br>
