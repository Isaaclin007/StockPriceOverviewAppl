#### In case of 'does not start/run'

*Note #1*. Try set up similar environment, see below.<br>

*Note #2*. This code is not actively maintained and it is 
possible that external dependencies, that this 
code is built to rely on, have changed or become defunct.

*Note #3*. There is some awkward possibility that program might 
not work in certain circumstances at all (or 
some unknown adjustment is needed), and some more 
adjustments/installations are needed.<br>
