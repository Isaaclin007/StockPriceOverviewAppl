# StockPriceOverviewAppl

**Simple/basic GUI program written in Python** that **uses tkinter** as GUI package and allows user:
- add/remove stock symbols to/from list;
- observe current price and historical price change of selected stock.

<br>

About specifics (that program was created with):
- Python 3.6.2
- tkinter 8.5
- googlefinance (0.7) [package]
- pandas (0.20.3) [package]
- pandas-datareader (0.5.0) [package]
- matplotlib (2.0.2) [package]
- json (2.0.9) [package]
- (and was run/tested under macOS 10).

Note #1: Haven't tested this program with other than mentioned specifics - it might and then again it might not work with different setup.<br> 
Note #2: There is always possiblity that when running some program written in Python, that some packages are not available/not in computer/environment where it is being run (then have to try to install them manually - but this is already, out of scope of this document, and specific to every python setup/environment).<br>
Note #3: And there is some awkward possibility that program might not work in certain circumstances at all, or some other adjustments are needed.<br>
